 SEUROPE_NAME: "Shattered Europe"
 SEUROPE_DESC: "Europe is fractured and under siege. The infighting of Christian kings has left them vulnerable to outside invaders. In the east the Mongol hordes are moving in from Siberia while Turkish missionaries have spread their faith over the Balkans. Southern Italy is in the midst of religious turmoil as Christian and Muslim Italians cross swords. To the west Moorish successors squabble over the remains of Spanish kingdoms. Meanwhile the untamed pagans to the north seek opportunities to expand."
